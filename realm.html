  <h2>What is Realm?</h2>
  <p>
    Realm is not just a Minecraft server &mdash; it is a parallel digital universe I’ve been building for the past 5 years.
    Originally started as a family world hosted on Realms, it evolved into a personal project blending my passions for computers, worldbuilding, and AI.
  </p>
  <p>
    The server now runs an expansive persistent world with deep history and player-built nations. Its core nation, <strong>Holy Umo</strong>,
    is centered around the towering Citadel &mdash; inspired by Half-Life 2 &mdash; and governs a world that blends medieval and sci-fi elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Technologies include a full <strong>GPS system</strong>, <strong>Movecraft ships</strong>, <strong>AI-driven NPCs</strong>, <strong>player economy</strong>, and
    <strong>server-to-server integrations</strong>. The world exceeds 100GB and is backed by my custom NAS solution. Dynamic map rendering and custom plugins
    allow the world to evolve continuously, with more than 1TB of world data planned in the near future.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am currently developing <strong>Kevin</strong>, an advanced AI agent that will inhabit the server and interact with players naturally &mdash;
    acting as the head of Holy Umo and a persistent character even when I’m offline. Inspired by Tron and Star Citizen, Realm represents my vision of a living digital space &mdash;
    an alternate world players can step into and help shape.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is my primary hobby and a long-term demonstration of my skills in server architecture, network management, storage design, and AI integration.
    To me, it’s more than a game &mdash; it’s a universe.
